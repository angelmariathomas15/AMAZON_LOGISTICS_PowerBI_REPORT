# 📦 Amazon Delivery Operations Analytics – Power BI

# 1. Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Amazon delivery operations data to evaluate delivery performance, operational efficiency, and customer experience metrics. The report transforms raw logistics and delivery records into actionable insights through structured data modeling, KPI development, and interactive visual analytics using Power BI Desktop.

The objective is to enable data-driven assessment of delivery timelines, order fulfillment patterns, regional performance, and service reliability.


# 2. Tech Stack

Key tools and technologies used in this project:

🖥️ Power BI Desktop – End-to-end report development and interactive visual analytics

🔄 Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing

🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – KPI calculations, measures, and business logic

📁 File Formats – .pbix for report development, .png for preview images

# 3. Data Source

Details about the dataset and its structure:

📄 Source Type – Amazon Delivery dataset (CSV format) from Kaggle

📊 Dataset Size – 43,000+ delivery records

🗂️ Data Coverage – Order details and timestamps, delivery time, traffic conditions, vehicle type, weather conditions, delivery agent ratings, etc

🧹 Preprocessing – Data cleaning, data type corrections, handling missing values, category standardization, and creation of supporting lookup tables were performed using Power Query before analysis.

# 4. Features / Highlights
   
🧩 Business Problem

Last-mile delivery operations are highly sensitive to traffic, time delays, and operational constraints. Without structured analysis, it becomes difficult to:

▪ Monitor delivery efficiency

▪ Understand traffic-related delays

▪ Identify operational bottlenecks

▪ Evaluate overall service performance

This project addresses these challenges by delivering a data-driven operational view of delivery performance.

🎯 Goal of the Report

The primary goals of this Power BI report are to:

▪ Provide an executive-level overview of delivery performance

▪ Analyze delivery timelines and operational efficiency

▪ Measure the impact of traffic severity on delivery outcomes

▪ Support data-driven decision-making in logistics operations

📊 Walkthrough of Key Report Pages & Visuals

# 🟦 Executive Overview

▪ High-level trend analysis to assess overall delivery health

# 🟩 Operational Performance Analysis

▪ Delivery Time analysis by vehicle and category

▪ On-Time vs Late delivery comparison

▪ Performance KPIs to evaluate operational efficiency

# 🟨 Traffic Analysis

▪ Order volume distribution across traffic conditions

▪ Delivery time comparison by traffic severity

▪ Identification of High and Jam traffic impact on delays

💡 Business Impact & Insights

▪ Identifies how traffic conditions directly affect delivery timelines

▪ Highlights operational inefficiencies contributing to delivery delays

▪ Enables better planning for high and jam traffic scenarios

▪ Supports performance monitoring and optimization for logistics teams

# 5. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the practical application of Power BI for operational analytics, combining EDA, data modeling, DAX measures, and structured report design to deliver business-ready insights. It reflects real-world analytical workflows relevant to Data Analyst and BI Analyst roles.
